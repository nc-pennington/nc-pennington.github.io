00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,002
Okay, my people, check it out.

346
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,491
That“.

347
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,769
This... Dax, the tech guy.
Did you call the tech guy?

348
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,201
Yeah, I talked to him.

349
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,443
Do you understand that everything
else in my life works?

350
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,881
Uh-huh.

351
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,644
So, I just need everything
here to work, too, okay?

352
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,848
Well, he said he was gonna call me back.
Oh, my God.

353
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,921
You want me to call him now?

354
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,883
(WHISPERING) Don't do it now.

355
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,241
Okay.

356
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,801
There we go.

357
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,887
That is the Lion himself.

358
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,408
That is the legendary
Snoop D-O-Double-G

359
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,131
singing <i>White</i> Christmas at a
tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

360
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,282
And he was so moved
by the power of music

361
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,044
to unite the world
or some shit,

362
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,521
that now he wants to drop
his own cool Christmas album.

363
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,808
And because I sleep
on a bed of Grammys,

364
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,361
he has decided to hire me
to produce it. Now...

365
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,442
But Snoop Dogg already dropped
a Christmas album.

366
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,568
If you had listened to
the album like I did,

367
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,770
stranded in the air with T.l.
on a golden hang glider,

368
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,202
then you would have known that none
of the songs were the classics.

369
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,170
I've had to listen to that album
on two separate occasions.

370
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,890
Hang glider with T.I.

371
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,486
and also a rocket ship
that Eminem has built.

372
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,443
It doesn't go anywhere,

373
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,483
but he's got dreams
for it, okay?

374
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,166
So I need you to
close your mouth.

375
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,163
Herein lies the problem,
everybody.

376
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,330
Last time I checked, there are
over a million Christmas albums

377
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,926
with the same
10 damn songs on them.

378
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,764
So, guys, I'm telling you, man,

379
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,002
I need all hands
on deck right now

380
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,203
to come up with ideas on how
to make this one stand out.

381
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,725
Okay? You got it?

382
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,890
Fire when ready.
I want to hear ideas.

383
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,680
Anything.

384
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,520
Anybody-

385
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,647
Anybody right now
would be great.

386
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,290
Anybody to talk...
What if we got those dogs...

387
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,850
Anybody but you.

388
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,931
What if we got those dogs that
bark Jingle <i>Bells</i> to back him up?

389
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,650
And let me, let me,
let me guess, let me guess.

390
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,929
You want those dogs to back him
up because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

391
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,967
Yeah!

392
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,963
That is a really great example

393
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,804
of a horrible idea.

394
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,641

395
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,530

a little more time.

one minute. 60 seconds.

1041
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,689
That's sort of what I do.

1042
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,162
Listen, Reggie. Is it "Reggie"?

1043
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,970
"Beca."

1044
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,327
Um, that happens a lot, though.
You'd be surprised.

1045
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,401
Okay.

1046
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,891
Here's the thing.

1047
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,770
Um, any kid with ears
and a laptop can do that.

1048
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,365
Dax can do that.

1049
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,601
All right? Right.

1050
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,160
So that's fine
if you want a career

out in the desert.

1052
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,049
But if you want to write "music
producer" on your tax forms someday,

1053
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,122
then you've gotta have an original voice.
Do you understand?

1054
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,328
You've gotta show me
what you have.

1055
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,085
Right now, what I have is a
demo with mash-ups on it.

1056
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,241
Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,681
I got lots of stuff to say.
I'm just saving it all up.

1058
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,807
Look“.

1059
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,121
Uh...

1060
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,086
What is it? "Beca"? Beca.

1061
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,161
Okay, yeah.

1062
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,685
So, you're an intern,

1063
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,683
and everybody else
in here is an intern.

1064
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,923
You're talented, everybody
else in here is talented.

1065
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,364
So what the hell makes you special?
Do you know what I mean?

1066
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,930
That's good.

1067
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,800
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna give you one more shot

1068
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,090
to show me who you are
as an artist. Okay?

1069
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,571
Do not waste it.

1070
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,882
No, sir, will not waste it.

be a music producer.

brought you here tonight

1213
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,842
Then that's it. Then I
guess that's it, right?

1214
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,731
Because I'm not gonna
keep going on like this.

1215
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,285
Well... Fine.

1216
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,967
Fine, if that's how you feel,
then I think we're done.

1217
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,166
I think it's over.

1218
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,010
That's it? That's it, then.

1219
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,645
So it's over, then.

1220
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,926
Fine. Then it's over.

1221
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,241
Fine, then.

1222
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,001
BUMPER; No!

1223
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,288
Too late. You're too late!

1224
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,930
I figured when we
didn't do the serenade,

1225
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,445
the back-up plan
should be to play her off.

1226
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,680
BUMPER: Turn around. Go back.

1227
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,410
I don't wanna
hear another peep!

it's my first performance.

1231
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,604
CHLOE: Calm down. It's just a chance
for us to rehearse for Worlds.

1232
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,331
As far as I can tell, it's just
for a bunch of old people.

There's a full house out there.

1236
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,090
How did we get this gig again?

1237
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,526
They called us.

1238
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,681
You know what, guys?

1239
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,086
I know we're trying
a lot of new stuff,

1240
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,525
but I feel like
we're gonna get out there

1241
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,886
and we're gonna feel the energy

1242
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,610
and we are just
gonna nail all of it!

1243
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,091
Sorry, these braids
are so tight.

1244
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,083
You know what?
I don't know. I don't know.

1245
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,650
I have many, many doubts,

1246
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,007
because if we fail this,
then we won't win the Worlds,

1247
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,809
and if we don't win the Worlds,
there will be no more Bellas,

1248
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,881
and without the Bellas,

1249
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,844
then my life
would have had no...

1250
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,411
"Malaria."

1251
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,322

1255
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,887
We are following the story of
the embattled Barden Bellas

1256
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,724
on their road to redemption.

1257
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,844
Trying to crawl their way back

And if they can just hold off

of their genitalia,

1260
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,847
they may make it to
the World Championship.

Well, I can't un-see it.

Well, there's
a picture of it right here.

1264

No. This should not be
your screensaver, John.

Honestly, my senses
are overwhelmed here, John.

JOHN: They might wanna
tone down the theatrics.

1275

Let's hope there are no props.

the props out, John.

JOHN: And there are the props.

1278
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,041
This is more of a circus act
than an a cappella performance.

Gail, it's as if
the Barden Bellas

that the Barden Bellas have
no shot at reinstatement.

Is that for a class?

No, it's just
when I get stressed,

1299

words sort of
flow right out of me

1300
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,845
and I try and channel them
in my songwriting...

1301

what happened back there?

The Worlds are
right around the corner

and you guys are acting like we
didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!

Why are you yelling at me?

I almost burned to death
because of you a-ca-bitches.

1307
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,451
If you almost died,
it was only because

1308
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,920
you were standing
in the wrong spot.

Sure. Blame the minority.

1311
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,651
I'm black, gay, and a woman.

1312
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,802
I'm not pointing
the finger at anybody.

1313
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,200
It was Legacy's fault.

1314
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,481
Me? Wait, I didn't...

1315
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,080
Obviously, we're not gonna beat
Das Sound Machine at their game.

1316
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,561
So we need a new plan.
Like, now.

1317

At times like these, there's
only one thing for us to do.

I don't know.
No, Mom, it's bad. It's...

1324
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,646
The girls are yelling at each other.
Oh, big deal.

1325
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,609
I remember
putting your godmother,

1326
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,409
Maggie Pistol, in a choke hold,

1327
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,727
because she insisted
that George Michael was gay.

1328
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,850
Who? Oh.

1329
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,490
I'm just worried that
my entire Bella career

1330
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,767
will be that
one terrible performance.

1331
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,009
And I'll never get to solo
at Lincoln Center, you know?

1332
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,850
But you're gonna
get to go to Europe.

1333
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,930
That would have been the
highlight of my college career.

1334
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,610
And you girls can win it.

1335
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,125
You have to win it.

1336
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,011
You just made being a Bella
sound so amazing.

1337
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,770
And it is amazing.

1338
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,561
It's a sisterhood that is gonna support
you for the rest of your life.

1339
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,604
I know you're not feeling it,

1340
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,006
but you will.

1341
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,726
This won't be the end
of the Bellas.

1344
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,601
Listen, I think you're missing a word here.
What's that?

1345
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,323
Oh, God. No. That's not... That
isn't what I meant. I just...

1346
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,401
EMILY: I didn't think so.

1347
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,845
That's really embarrassing.
No, it looks...

1348
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,001
Syntax is usually my forte,

1349
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,690
so I don't know how that happened.
Well, it looks great.

1350

That's really sweet...

When my hands aren't
covered in glitter paint,

1353
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,087
do you think maybe
we could try that again?

1354
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,924
Yeah. Sure.

1355
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,651

01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,209
where Fortune 500
companies send

1381
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,964
their employees to
build teamwork skills.

1382
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,804
You run this whole place?

1383
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,161
You know,
I realized I had a knack for

1384
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,447
barking orders and
bending people's will.

1385
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,602
So I made a career out of it.

(ALL LAUGHING)

1387
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,246

1388
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,004
fall in line, Bellas!

1389
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,161
CYNTHIA: She ain't changed.

1390
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,168
No slouching! No straggling!

1391
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,083
I see you, Jessica.

1392
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,485
It is with great
sorrow and regret

1393
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,691
that I had to watch
our once proud organization

1394
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,923
become a national disgrace!

1395
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,484
Can I have the keys
to the minibar?

1396
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,005
Zip it.

1397
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,367
The Worlds signifies
a shot at redemption.

1398
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,045
You don't have
a chance at winning

1399
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,441
until you find
your sound again.

1400
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,251
You have totally
lost your harmony!

1401
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,051
So, for the next two days,

1402
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,886
you will be doing everything
together until you regain it.

1403
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,164
Ladies,
get ready to be transformed.

1404
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,088
You are surrounded with the
strength of your fellow Bellas

1405
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,201
and the support of
a proud female tradition.

1406
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,249
And a few dozen bear traps.

1407
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,651

from the marked paths.

1408

Okay, great, let's go!
EMILY: All right.

1409
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,486
Well, maybe I'll just
start with a hot shower,

1410
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,766
maybe a little foot rub.

1411
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,764
Fat Amy, there are no
guest rooms for you.

1412
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,928
Then where are we staying?

1413
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,650
I don't understand camping.

1414
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,121
We're voluntarily
living like dogs.

1415

BECA: This is the worst.

1416
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,325
The air we're breathing right
now is at least 90% fart.

1417

That reminds me,

1418
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,283
I need to see
a man about a horse.

1419
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,921
Oh!

1420
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,805
Did anyone happen to pack
a spare roll of toilet paper?

1421
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,685
Or a moist towelette?
CHLOE: Nope.

1422
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,289
Anyone have a T-shirt,
size extra-small?

1423
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,366
Okay. Side of the tent it is.

1424

What are we doing here?

1425
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,246
We're bonding.

1426
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,288
You seem so tense.
Do you need a back rub?

1427
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,601
Several body parts are rubbing
my back right now, thank you.

1428

You know, Beca,
we're very close,

1429

but I feel like this retreat
is really gonna let us

1430
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,610
discover everything
about each other.

1431
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,681
Is that right?

1432
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,530
You know,
one of my biggest regrets

1433
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,331
is that I didn't do enough
experimenting in college.

1434
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,041
You're so weird.

1435

to sing as a group,

have said something...

1566
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,285
Yeah, I know. But I'm
weird about that stuff.

out on my own, and I can't.

It's really scary.

Yeah, it actually
does seem like it,

holding it together.

have to be scary, Chloe.

I never pictured myself

running a retreat in
the middle of the woods,

I'll pursue my passion.

01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,327
I'll teach underprivileged
children how to sing,

1607
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,363

Stop asking. I'll tell you.

So, after I graduate there's
a chance I will be deported.

1616
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,363
I will try to
re-enter this country,

1617
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,363

they described themselves.

They're "Manila Envy."

the Koreans are out there,

1820

01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,242
Guys, there's gonna be
some haters out there.

1902
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,729
They're gonna
look at us, Team USA,

1903
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,644
and be like, "Why is the most
talented one Australian?"

1904

Well, guess what. Lam fat.
So that is close enough.
